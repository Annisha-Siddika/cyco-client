## Project Name: Cyco.tv

### Goal: Selective and issue based online OTT platform to make a positive impact in our targeted audience and their life. 

## Feature Planning and why ?
<p>Cyko-tv. A ‘Mern’ stack project. The Idea is to build an OTT (over-the-top) platform. As we mentioned in our goal. We Cyco team members believe that modern technology has the power to bring changes and make a positive impact to society. And that's why we choose the opportunity to build an OTT platform. 

An OTT platform could be a solid media to enter and take place on someone's lap, palm or desk and nowadays by smart tv in everyone's drawing room. Our market analysis says that it is a trending and booming industry. 

Let's come to the point. There are thousands of other platforms and giant companies have thousands of functionalities in their app, so why will people use our app and will buy our subscription? 

	Yes, in this key point we decided to target our future subscribers and viewers. Here we draw down our boundary of thinking and decide to be unique and start as small. Mainly we target the user experience and their role. We target to play with user role end experience along with selective and issue based video streaming. 

Everyone will be our viewer but only subscribed members will be allowed to contribute. And you know what, it is an improvising process, and time will decide what the user can do and can’t. Beside this our every video will have a category, test and genre. A high profile searching and bookmark or saving functionality will generate great user experience. 

Users will be allowed to choose their role, like Grandpa, Grandma, guardians, Analyst, Researchers, House wife student etc and they will be suggested their kinds of videos or movies or songs or live streamings. 


This is our primary goal to move forward. With a dream to integrate an AI and create a modern forum to engage more users and generate sustainability of the project.
